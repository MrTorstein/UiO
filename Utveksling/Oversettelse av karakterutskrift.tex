\textbf{Point- and gradesystem} \\
A year of study normaly contains 10 months. A full studyyear is estimated at 1500 - 1800 hours of work and 60 points \\

The norwegian gradesystem contains two gradescales: one scale with grades passed and not passed and a graded letter scale from A to E as passgrades and F as failgrades. For the graded scale, the following qualitative descriptions explane the different grades:

	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline 
\textbf{A} & Remarkable & Remarkable achievement. The candidate showes a very good ability to debate \\
 &  & and a large grade of independence. \\
\hline
\textbf{B} & Quite good & Quite good achievement. The candidate shows quite good abillities in \\
 &  & consideration and independance. \\
\hline
\textbf{C} & Good & Generaly good achievement. The candidate shows the ability consideration and act independantly \\
 &  & in the most importante areas. \\
\hline
\textbf{D} & Acceptable & An acceptable achievement with some importante pieces missing. The student is sometimes \\
 &  & able to debate an answere and act independantly. \\
\hline
\textbf{E} & Enought & The student achieved enought to pass. He/she shows little ability to act on his own accorde. \\
\hline
\textbf{F} & Fail & The student did not manage the minimum demands. He/she is unable to act independantly. \\
\hline
	\end{tabular}
The grade system is absolute. This means that the professores use specific criteries when correcting a test. \\

\textbf{Grade distribution} \\
The grade distribution showes the percent of the students obtaining a spesific grade from A - F. The amount of failed students are not shown in the distribution. All resultes from the last five years are taken into account. The distribution for courses active for less then five years are also shown. For a distribution to be shown there have to be a least 10 passed resultes.
